# DSC 210 Project

Please follow the below installation instructions before beginning the assignment.

Tools you will need:
* Matplotlib
* PIL
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Sklearn
* Time
* Pytorch
* Collections 
Make sure you run on Google Colab!!

## Spectral Clustering (under the spectral_clustering_experiment subfolder on GitHub):
1. Download all the images into your personal directory in your computer drivel drive
2. Similarly, download excel spreadsheet that has names of the file directories
3. Run top to bottom
3.1 replace file directory to match yours for excel spreadsheet and for image.open (2nd and 4th block of the code)
4. rerun with different list entries to see different clustered images
One potential result for the variable "hold":
![Alt text](one.jpg?raw=true "Title")
And for the variable "a":
![Alt text](two.jpg?raw=true "Title")
## ResNet (under the image_segmentation_project subfolder on GitHub):
1. If downloading folder from Github, clone it and then upload image_segmentation_project
2. Move idd20kll folder into image segmentation project folder
3. Run in order from top to bottom
4. Note for the first cell: make sure to authenticate user name when asked where to mount
NOTE: in section with comment “# Run this cell to train the model from scratch”
    4.1. recommended not to run because training it will take longer than an hour to train
    4.2. Tri was able run it faster by paying for additional computes

Results:
![Alt text](three.jpg?raw=true "Title")
